The idea of treating engineering platforms as products has been getting a lot of traction recently. We're thinking in
terms of "platform-as-a-product", we're doing user research and user interviews, we're hiring platform product managers,
we're doing A/B testing on platform capabilities. This is good, valuable work, and I support it.

But more and more I feel like there's a sort of chicken-and-egg problem here. Hiring a platform product manager isn't
the first step of building a platform. It can't be the first thing, because it can't happen unless there has been prior
work to demonstrate the value of having a platform product manager - there is a "get buy-in" step that precedes it.

This is a [zero-to-one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One) problem. We're talking about platform-as-a-product,
but how do you get from "nothing" to "product"? With a startup!

Let's start using the term **platform-as-a-startup** instead of platform-as-a-product, at least when we're talking
about making an initial investment in platform engineering, or working on driving early adoption. I think that this
new term will help focus our energies appropriately.

Let's think about _runway_. Our organization has made an initial investment in our platform engineering effort - we
need to build a platform engineering practice that is self-sustaining, before that investment is exhausted. Let's feel
the pressure of the market, the pressure to deliver value.

Let's think about [_doing things that don't scale_](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html). If the app development teams have
a cumbersome, manual deployment process, and each team is spending significant time each week just deploying their
services, maybe the platform engineering team can start doing _all_ deployments.
[If it hurts, do it more often](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html).

Let's think about _finding product-market-fit_. Let's run experiments that turn hypothetical questions into data. Let's
do more of what works and let's fail fast and stop doing what doesn't work.

Let's think about _marketing_. It's not enough to do the work - people have to know about it. (I'm a fan of
[the Stripe model](https://steinkamp.us/posts/2022-11-10-what-i-learned-at-stripe)
here - a project is not "shipped" until it's been communicated to the organization.)

Let's think about _customers_ of the platform, rather than _users_ of the platform. Let's recognize that developers
have a choice, and let's deliver platform capabilities that developers choose freely over their status quo processes.

Let's build our platforms from zero with a startup mindset, and move to a more "typical" product model once we have
gotten from zero to one.
