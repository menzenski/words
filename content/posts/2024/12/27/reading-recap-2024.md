For the last eight years I've set myself a reading goal of twelve books a year.
I started this practice the year after I dropped out of a humanities graduate
program - I was a voracious reader as a kid, and was reading a ton in graduate
school, and then I left graduate school and found that my reading just sort of
... stopped. So I started tracking what I was reading, and started setting an
annual reading goal, in the hopes of keeping up the habit.

In my post-school adult life, though, it's been hard to make time for reading.
In eight years of goal-setting, I've met my twelve-book goal only twice, and in
one of those years I read no books at all (!!).

This year, I read 13 books, exceeding my goal by one. Here's what I read in
2024:
