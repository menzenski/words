For the last eight years I've set myself a reading goal of twelve books a year.
I started this practice the year after I dropped out of a humanities graduate
program - I was a voracious reader as a kid, and was reading a ton in graduate
school, and then I left graduate school and found that my reading just sort of
... stopped. So I started tracking what I was reading, and started setting an
annual reading goal, in the hopes of keeping up the habit.

In my post-school adult life, though, it's been hard to make time for reading.
In eight years of goal-setting, I've met my twelve-book goal only twice, and in
one of those years I read no books at all (!!).

This year, I read 13 books, exceeding my goal by one. Here's what I read in
2024:

**_Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders_** by
L. David Marquet (finished on January 22)

I'd seen this book recommended in the engineering leadership circles I frequent
and finally read it myself. It's great - it's a short, easy read that's easy to
digest, and I came away feeling like I really understood the book's content -
I felt like I was able to apply lessons from the book pretty much immediately.

I wish I'd found this book several years earlier, really. In early 2020 I
became the lead, then manager, for a maintenance/operations-focused engineering
team. I'd arrived at some of the strategies in this book on my own
(intent-based leadership, mainly) but would have loved to have the other
strategies from this book in my toolkit then too.

**_On Trails: An Exploration_** by Robert Moor (finished on March 31)

This book was incredible. We rented a little cabin in the ozarks for a week
during my son's spring break, to give our kids (ages 5 and 2 at the time)
their first taste of camping. The cabin had a few books in it - this was one
of them. I devoured in just a day or two (thank you, time pressure of not
being able to take the book home!). Partly I just really love this genre of
nonfiction - a sort of anthropological/historical/scientific look at something
that's part of daily life, but this book also really left me with a ton of
new ideas about platform engineering, which was very unexpected.

We talk a lot about "paved roads" and "golden paths" in platform engineering.
_On Trails_ helped me gain a fuller understanding of where reads and paths
really come from - of the hidden and implicit constraints on their creation
and use. That understanding has helped me build better conceptual models of
the platform engineering domain.

**_Mountains of the Mind: A History of a Fascination_** by Robert Macfarlane
(finished on May 31)

I had read _Underland: A Deep Time Journey_ by the same author a few years
ago, and loved it. I think I saw _Mountains of the Mind_ cited in _On Trails_
and read it shortly afterwards. I liked it, but I didn't love it. It's about
Mount Everest, and our human interest in it. It was published in 2003 to
coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the first known summit of Mount
Everest (by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hilary), but oddly (in my opinion) the
book doesn't cover through that 1953 event - its narrative ends in 1924 with
George Mallory's last expedition.

**_So Good The Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for
Work you Love_** by Cal Newport (finished August 21)

**_Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World_** by Cal
Newport (finished on August 29)

**_Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World_** by Cal
Newport (finished on September 7)

**_A World Without Email_** by Cal Newport (finished on November 10)

(I'm reviewing these Cal Newport books together here, even though it means the
list gets a little out-of-order as a result. Sorry.)

Early this year I changed roles - I changed from senior engineering manager
to a principal engineer. One effect of that change was in my schedule - I went
from a manager's schedule with lots of meetings, every day, to a
[maker's schedule](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) with few
meetings, and some days with no meetings. This took a lot of getting used to.
Apparently I had become accustomed to doing "maker work" in small chunks, in
between meetings, and to relying on meetings (meetings which were
mostly scheduled by other people, not by me) to structure my days. Losing that
structure required some adjustments. As I started to research more about
time management in knowledge work, Cal Newport's name kept coming up. I ended
up deciding to read his books in publish order, in the hopes that I'd gain
some clarity about managing my time and energy more effectively.

**_Sword-Dancer (Tiger and Del #1)_** by Jennifer Roberson (finished on
September 8)

In July, my family and I did a big road trip around the western United States.
We spent a week driving from home in Kansas City, Missouri out to Los Angeles,
California (through Oklahoma City, Amarillo, Albuquerque, Flagstaff, Needles,
and Barstow) to attend a friend's wedding in San Pedro. Then we spent a week
driving back home via a more northerly route (Las Vegas, St. George, Moab,
Denver, Cheyenne, Rapid City, Devil's Tower, Sioux Falls, Albert Lea,
Kansas City). Our friend and his bride are both big nerds (the best kind of
people) and they gave all wedding guests a gift: a pulpy 80s fantasy novel
was placed at each table setting at the reception. I suspect they visited a
used book store, pointed at the fantasy shelf, and told the cashier "we'll
take it all". My wife and I were given the first two books in the
_Tiger and Del_ series by Jennifer Roberson. _Sword-Dancer_ (the first in
the series) was published in the mid-eighties. It, uh, has not aged well.
It was hard to finish, actually - it's full of unoriginal tropes and should
come with a list of content warnings. But I did finish it, and I plan to read
the second one (the other one we were gifted) as well. But I can't imagine I'll
read any additional entries in this series.

**_Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World_** by David Epstein
(finished on September 16)

_Range_ is an incredible book. Its central thesis is that if you specialize
early, you'll see benefits in the shorter term, but if you specialize late,
you'll see benefits in the longer term, and those benefits from late
specialization are likely to be more significant - the career-making kind.

**_Robust Python: Write Clean and Maintainable Code_** by Patrick Viafore
(finished on November 16)

**_Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout_** by
Cal Newport (finished November 25)

**_Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life_** by Anne Lamott
(finished November 25)

**_The Great River: The Making and Unmaking of the Mississippi_** by Bryce
Upholt (finished December 1)
